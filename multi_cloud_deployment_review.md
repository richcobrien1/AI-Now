# Multi-Cloud Deployment Architecture

## Key Points

The document outlines architectural changes needed to deploy a lead generation platform across multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean):

### Key Architectural Changes for Multi-Cloud Deployment

#### 1. Containerization and Orchestration
- **Docker** becomes essential for packaging applications and dependencies, ensuring consistent deployments across all clouds
- **Kubernetes** (or managed variants like AWS EKS, GCP GKE, DigitalOcean Kubernetes) orchestrates containers, handles scaling, and abstracts away cloud-specific infrastructure differences

#### 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Use **Terraform** or **Pulumi** to define and provision infrastructure across multiple clouds in a consistent, repeatable way
- Maintain modular IaC code with cloud-specific modules for networking, storage, and compute resources

#### 3. Cloud-Agnostic Services and Abstractions
- Avoid cloud-provider lock-in by using open-source or multi-cloud compatible services:
  - For databases: PostgreSQL via managed services or self-hosted
  - For messaging: RabbitMQ, Kafka
  - For storage: MinIO or S3-compatible APIs
- Use APIs and service abstractions to decouple application logic from provider-specific services

#### 4. Centralized CI/CD and Monitoring
- Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins) that can deploy to any cloud using IaC and Docker images
- Use centralized logging and monitoring tools that aggregate data across clouds (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog)

#### 5. Networking, Security, and Governance
- Standardize networking and security practices across clouds, ensuring consistent policies, encryption, and access control
- Use cross-cloud networking solutions if needed (e.g., Google Cross-Cloud Interconnect) to ensure data/application portability
- Establish clear governance, tagging, and resource ownership policies across all providers

### Example Directory Structure for Multi-Cloud

```
/leadgen-platform
├── /frontend/
├── /backend/
├── /infrastructure/
│   ├── /terraform/
│   │   ├── /aws/
│   │   ├── /gcp/
│   │   ├── /digitalocean/
│   │   └── /modules/
│   └── /k8s/
│       ├── /base/
│       └── /overlays/
│           ├── /aws/
│           ├── /gcp/
│           └── /digitalocean/
├── /automation/
├── /database/
├── /docs/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
└── .env
```

Key directory components:
- **/infrastructure/terraform/**: IaC scripts for each cloud, plus reusable modules
- **/infrastructure/k8s/**: Base Kubernetes manifests and overlays for each provider
- **Dockerfile/docker-compose.yml**: Ensures local development and cloud deployment consistency

### Summary Table: Multi-Cloud Architecture Essentials

| Component | Recommendation | Rationale/Benefit |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Containerization | Docker, Kubernetes | Portability, scalability, consistency |
| IaC | Terraform, Pulumi | Consistent infra provisioning everywhere |
| CI/CD | Cloud-agnostic (e.g., GitHub Actions) | Unified deployment pipeline |
| Database/Storage | Cloud-agnostic or self-hosted | Avoid lock-in, enable portability |
| Monitoring/Logging | Centralized, cross-cloud tools | Unified visibility and troubleshooting |
| Security/Governance | Standardized policies, tagging | Compliance and operational clarity |

## Technical Architecture Highlights

- Cloud-agnostic containerization with Kubernetes
- Infrastructure as Code for consistent provisioning
- Modular directory structure supporting multi-cloud deployment
- Standardized security and governance across providers
- Centralized monitoring and CI/CD pipelines
