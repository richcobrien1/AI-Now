## Key Points

The document outlines a practical, step-by-step MVP gameplan for an AI-powered, datascraping-enabled lead generation platform with a 3-4 month timeline:

### 1. Ideation & Planning (Week 1-2)
- Define target audience: Profile business owner clients and pain points
- Market research: Analyze competitors, validate demand, identify gaps
- Feature prioritization: Focus on must-have features for launch (automated lead scraping, basic enrichment, simple outreach)
- Success metrics: Number of leads generated, outreach response rate

### 2. Design & Prototyping (Week 3-4)
- Wireframes & user flows: Sourcing leads, verifying contacts, launching outreach
- UI/UX design: Simple, intuitive interfaces for core workflows
- Prototype testing: Validate with target users

### 3. Development (Week 5-10)
- Core stack: Docker/Kubernetes for portability, Node.js/Python backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL/MongoDB storage
- Datascraping integration: ZenRows, PhantomBuster, or similar tools; automation with Make.com or n8n
- Enrichment & verification: Apollo.io/Clay for enrichment, NeverBounce/ZeroBounce for email verification
- Outreach module: Simple campaign creator for personalized email sequences
- Minimal CRM integration: Google Sheets or Airtable for MVP simplicity

### 4. Testing (Week 11-12)
