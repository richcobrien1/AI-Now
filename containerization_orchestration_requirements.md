# Containerization and Orchestration Requirements

Based on the comprehensive review of all documents, here are the key containerization and orchestration requirements for the AI-Now platform:

## Docker Containerization

### Container Design
- **Base Images**: Lightweight Alpine-based images for minimal footprint
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Separation of build and runtime environments
- **Layer Optimization**: Minimizing image size and number of layers
- **Development vs. Production**: Distinct Dockerfiles for different environments

### Container Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Externalized configuration via environment variables
- **Config Files**: Mounted configuration files for complex settings
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of sensitive information
- **Resource Limits**: Explicit CPU and memory constraints

### Container Networking
- **Service Discovery**: Automatic discovery of dependent services
- **Port Mapping**: Consistent port mapping conventions
- **Network Isolation**: Proper network segmentation for security

### Container Storage
- **Volume Management**: Persistent storage for stateful containers
- **Data Sharing**: Controlled sharing of data between containers
- **Backup Integration**: Support for backup and restore operations

## Kubernetes Orchestration

### Cluster Architecture
- **Multi-Cloud Support**: Deployment across AWS EKS, GCP GKE, DigitalOcean Kubernetes
- **Control Plane**: Highly available control plane configuration
- **Node Pools**: Specialized node pools for different workload types
- **Regional/Multi-zone**: Distribution across availability zones for resilience

### Resource Organization
- **Namespace Strategy**: Logical separation of resources by namespace
- **Label/Annotation Standards**: Consistent labeling for resource identification
- **Resource Quotas**: Limits on resource consumption by namespace
- **Network Policies**: Micro-segmentation for enhanced security

### Deployment Strategies
- **Deployments**: Standard deployments for stateless applications
- **StatefulSets**: Ordered deployment for stateful applications
- **DaemonSets**: Node-level services like monitoring or logging
- **Jobs/CronJobs**: Batch and scheduled processing

### Configuration Management
- **ConfigMaps**: Externalized non-sensitive configuration
- **Secrets**: Secure storage of sensitive information
- **External Secrets**: Integration with external secret management systems
- **Config Versioning**: Tracking of configuration changes

### Service Exposure
- **Service Types**: Appropriate service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- **Ingress Controllers**: HTTP/HTTPS routing to services
- **API Gateway Integration**: Advanced routing and authentication
- **External DNS**: Automatic DNS management for services

## Orchestration Patterns

### Service Mesh
- **Istio/Linkerd**: Service mesh implementation for advanced networking
- **Traffic Management**: Sophisticated routing, splitting, and mirroring
- **Security**: Mutual TLS between services
- **Observability**: Detailed metrics, logs, and traces

### GitOps
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Declarative definition of all resources
- **Git as Source of Truth**: Git repositories as the definitive source
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated synchronization of cluster state
- **Drift Detection**: Identification and remediation of configuration drift

### Scaling Strategies
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscaling**: Automatic scaling based on metrics
- **Vertical Pod Autoscaling**: Adjustment of resource requests/limits
- **Cluster Autoscaling**: Dynamic adjustment of cluster size
- **Custom Metrics**: Scaling based on application-specific metrics

## Monitoring and Management

### Resource Monitoring
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization of metrics and dashboards
- **Custom Metrics**: Application-specific performance indicators
- **Alerting**: Proactive notification of issues

### Log Management
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregation of logs from all containers
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent log format for easier analysis
- **Log Retention**: Appropriate retention policies
- **Log Analysis**: Tools for searching and analyzing logs

### Tracing and Debugging
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing
- **Debugging Tools**: In-cluster debugging capabilities
- **Crash Diagnostics**: Automatic collection of crash information
- **Performance Analysis**: Tools for identifying bottlenecks

## Security and Compliance

### Container Security
- **Image Scanning**: Vulnerability scanning of container images
- **Runtime Security**: Protection against container escape and other threats
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for containers
- **Pod Security Policies**: Enforcement of security best practices

### Network Security
- **Network Policies**: Micro-segmentation of network traffic
- **Ingress/Egress Controls**: Strict control of external communication
- **Encryption**: TLS for all service-to-service communication
- **DDoS Protection**: Safeguards against denial of service attacks

### Compliance
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all operations
- **Policy Enforcement**: Automated enforcement of security policies
- **Compliance Scanning**: Regular checks for compliance issues
- **Remediation Workflows**: Processes for addressing findings
