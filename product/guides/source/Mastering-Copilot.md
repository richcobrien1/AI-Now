Bonus Guide: Common Prompt Mistakes & How to Fix Them

Avoid these common errors to maximize Copilot’s effectiveness:

Using Vague Prompts

❌ “Tell me about branding.” → Too broad, lacks specificity. ✅ “List three brand identity strategies for startups.” → Focused and actionable.

Overloading the Prompt

❌ “Give me marketing strategies, ad templates, SEO tips, and social media growth plans.” ✅ Break it into steps: First, request branding insights, then SEO tips separately.

Ignoring AI Formatting Tools

✔ Use bold, italics, and lists to structure AI responses for better readability.
