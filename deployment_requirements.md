# Deployment Requirements

Based on the comprehensive review of all documents, here are the key deployment requirements for the AI-Now platform:

## Multi-Platform Deployment

### Cloud Providers
- **Primary Platforms**: AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean
- **Flexibility**: Architecture must support deployment across any combination of these platforms
- **Consistency**: Identical functionality regardless of deployment platform

### Deployment Models
- **Single Cloud**: Support for deployment on a single cloud provider
- **Multi-Cloud**: Support for distribution across multiple cloud providers
- **Hybrid**: Potential for hybrid cloud/on-premises deployment

### Environment Separation
- **Development**: Isolated environment for development and testing
- **Staging/QA**: Pre-production environment for quality assurance
- **Production**: Highly available production environment

## Containerization

### Docker
- **Base Images**: Lightweight, security-focused base images (Alpine preferred)
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Separation of build and runtime environments
- **Development vs. Production**: Distinct Dockerfiles for development and production
- **Image Optimization**: Minimized image size and layer optimization

### Kubernetes
- **Resource Definitions**: Clear definition of compute resources (CPU, memory)
- **Namespace Organization**: Logical grouping of resources by namespace
- **ConfigMaps/Secrets**: Externalized configuration and sensitive information
- **StatefulSets**: Proper handling of stateful components (databases, etc.)
- **Services/Ingress**: Well-defined networking and external access

## Infrastructure as Code

### Terraform/Pulumi
- **Modularity**: Reusable modules for common infrastructure patterns
- **Provider Abstraction**: Abstraction layer to minimize provider-specific code
- **State Management**: Secure and reliable state storage
- **Environment Variables**: Parameterization for different environments

### Directory Organization
- **Provider-Specific Directories**: Separate directories for each cloud provider
- **Shared Modules**: Common modules shared across providers
- **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific configuration files

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Build Process
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Static Analysis**: Code quality and security scanning
- **Artifact Generation**: Versioned artifacts for deployment

### Deployment Process
- **Automated Deployment**: Zero-touch deployment to all environments
- **Rollback Capability**: Ability to quickly revert to previous versions
- **Blue/Green Deployment**: Support for zero-downtime deployments
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout of new features

### Pipeline Configuration
- **Pipeline as Code**: Definition of CI/CD pipelines in version control
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of environment-specific variables
- **Approval Gates**: Manual approval requirements for production deployments

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- **Centralized Logging**: Aggregation of logs from all components
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent log format for easier parsing
- **Log Retention**: Appropriate retention policies for different log types

### Metrics
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Application Metrics**: Request rates, error rates, latency
- **Business Metrics**: User engagement, conversion rates, etc.

### Alerting
- **Threshold-based Alerts**: Notifications based on metric thresholds
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identification of unusual patterns
- **Alert Routing**: Appropriate routing of alerts to responsible teams

## Security

### Network Security
- **VPC Configuration**: Proper network isolation
- **Security Groups**: Least-privilege access controls
- **WAF/DDoS Protection**: Protection against common web attacks

### Identity and Access
- **IAM Policies**: Least-privilege access for all services
- **Service Accounts**: Properly scoped service identities
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of credentials and secrets

### Compliance
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all security-relevant events
- **Compliance Scanning**: Regular scanning for compliance issues
- **Remediation Processes**: Clear processes for addressing security findings
