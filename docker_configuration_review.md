# Docker Configuration Guide for SafeShipping

## Key Points

The document provides a comprehensive Docker configuration guide for a blockchain-based supply chain solution called SafeShipping:

### Project Overview

SafeShipping is a blockchain-based supply chain solution that leverages:
- Smart contracts
- Decentralized oracles
- IoT integration
- Cross-chain interoperability

The solution aims to provide secure, transparent, and efficient shipping logistics.

### Directory Structure

The document outlines a detailed directory structure for Docker configurations:

```

### Service Configurations

The document includes detailed Dockerfile configurations for multiple services:

1. **Smart Contract Development Environment**
   - Development and production Dockerfiles
   - Based on Node.js Alpine images
   - Includes Solidity compiler, Truffle, Hardhat, and security analysis tools

2. **Blockchain Node**
   - Uses the official Ethereum client-go image
   - Includes configuration for different networks (mainnet, testnet, private)
   - Contains startup scripts and configuration files

3. **Oracle Service**
   - Development and production Dockerfiles
   - Integrates with Chainlink nodes
   - Connects to the blockchain node

4. **Backend API**
   - Development and production Dockerfiles
   - Node.js-based API service
   - Multi-stage builds for production

5. **Frontend**
   - Development and production Dockerfiles
   - Includes Nginx configuration for production
   - Optimized build process

6. **Security Service**
   - Development and production Dockerfiles
   - Handles authentication and authorization

### Docker Compose Configurations

The guide includes both development and production Docker Compose configurations that orchestrate all the services together.

## Technical Architecture Highlights

- Multi-stage builds for production optimization
- Separation of development and production environments
- Consistent use of Alpine-based images for minimal footprint
- Service-specific configurations and optimizations
- Comprehensive networking between services
- Environment variable management
- Volume mounting for persistent data
